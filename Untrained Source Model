DEFINITIONS
	
  	!Diffusion constants; Dl and Da from rescaled experimental values, Dc assumed same as Da, Dm assumed many orders smaller than Dl
    Dl = 5.2e1		!5.2e1, from Dabagh rescaled to 24 hr time and space according to Chalmers
    Da = 5.4e3		!5.4e3, from Paavola rescaled to 24 hr time and space according to Chalmers
    Dc = 5.4e3		!5.4e3, assumed the same as Da 
    Dm = 5.2e-3 	!4 orders of magnitude smaller than Dl, same rescale as Chalmers 
    
    !Decay constants; decay taken to be much smaller than other terms, values scaled to time, d_m assumed orders smaller than others
    d_l = 5.0e-1 
    d_a = 5.0e-1		
    d_c = 5.0e-1
    d_m = 5.0e-3	!2 orders smaller than other decays, same rescale as Chalmers
    
   !Rescalar constants; Mu_a, Mu_c, Mu_f rescaled to time and E_i (expression influx transporters)
    Mu_a = 4.0e1 	!chemoattractants per % influx per macrophage 
    Mu_c = 4.0e0 	!cytokines per % influx per macrophage
    Mu_f = 4.0e-2	!unit LDL per foam cell
    
    !Flux constants (boundary conditions); rescaled to time
    Sigma_a1 = 5.0e2
    Sigma_a2 = 5.0e0
    Sigma_c = 5.0e-3
    Xm = 5.0e-3
    
   !Bloodstream concentrations of chemoattractant and cytokines, chemoattractant production scalar, no time dependence, same as Chalmers
    A0 = 1.0e-1
    C0 = 1.0e-2 
    Beta_a = 1.0e0
    
	!Rate of LDL and monocyte entry to the intima
    Sigma_l = 1.0e1 	!Low LDL: 1.0e1, high LDL: 4.0e1
    Sigma_m = 1.0e-6 	!Range: (low) 1.0e-6, 4.0e-6, 7.0e-6, 1.0e-5 (high)
    
    !Epigenetic training modifiers; E_a=chemoattractant production rescalar, E_c=cytokine production rescalar
    E_a = 1 	!Untrained: E_a= 1, trained: E_a=3
    E_c = 1 	!Untrained: E_c=1, trained: E_c=4
    !E_i=influx transporter expression, E_e=efflux transporter expression
    E_i = 116.28 * (ln(l + 11.3) - 1.4)
    E_e = 78.00 * (ln(l + 3.2) - 0.2)
    
    !Influx and efflux
    Influx = m * l * E_i  / (1.0 + l)
    Efflux = m * l * E_e / (1.0 + l)

EQUATIONS
!PDEs for the 5 species, rearranged to match FlexPDE requirements
   l:		Dl*del2(l) {diffusion from lumen} = Influx {consumption} + d_l * l {decay} + dt(l) {PDE of l with respect to time}
    
   a:		Da*del2(a) {diffusion from lumen} = -E_a  * Mu_a * Influx {consumption} + d_a * a {decay} + dt(a) {PDE of a with respect to time}

	 c:		Dc*del2(c) {diffusion from lumen} = -E_c * Mu_c * Influx {consumption} + d_c * c {decay} + dt(c) {PDE of c with respect to time}

   f:		dt(f) {PDE of f with respect to time} = Mu_f  * (Influx - Efflux)
